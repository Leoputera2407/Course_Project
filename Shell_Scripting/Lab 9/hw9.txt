Homework 9

2. `git checkout v3.0 -b quote`
-- Check out of v3.0 and into a new "quote" branch

3.`patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt`
-- Apply patch so all ` is '

5. Use Emacs "C-x 4 a" to go into a changelog buffer. 
   `emacs src/cmp.c`
   `emacs src/diff.c`
   `emacs src/diff3.c`
   `emacs src/dir.c`
   `emacs src/sdiff.c`
   `emacs src/util.c`
  -- And insert each file's respective change log from the original patch, quote-3.0-patch.txt.

 6. `git add .`
 -- To stage all files that are modified
 `git commit -F ChangeLog`
 -- Use the -F as we only want to commit the ChangeLog file specifically

 7. `git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt`
 -- Use the same command as in lab to generate a new patch file.

 8. `git checkout -b partner`
 -- Checkout of quote and into a new branch, "partner"
 -- scp partner's patch, which he (Varun Narayanan) send to me.

 `git am < ../partner-patch.txt`
 `git log`
-- Use the command above to check if patch was done properly.
-- Below was stdout-ed. This show that the patch was success.
