Homework 3


Q1. The patch improves the correctness, but not the performance. Only an if-else statement is changed, so it's still O(1), and then improvement in performance should be insignificant.

Q2. Date format in coreutils follows US system; international users, who are more used to DDMMYY format, need to take note od the different date stamp when using coreutils.

Q3. Running `./randline.py /dev/null`
	Here's what's outputed:
	 return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is empty
	 IndexError: list index out of range

	--/dev/null is an empty file. randline.py tries to index an empty file leading to an "out of range" error.

Q4. Running `python3 randline.py`
	You get this as an output:
	  except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
	  SyntaxError: invalid syntax

	--Tuple unpacking on exception object was removed in Python3. In Python3, a single parameter needs to be passed in explicitly into the exception, like this:
		except IOError as err
			 parser.error("I/O error({0}): {1}".format(err.errno, err.args[0]))
